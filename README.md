# -Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-

Project Title: Iris Flower Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Objective: Developed a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Approach/Methodology:

Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Utilized the Iris dataset from the scikit-learn library.
Applied techniques such as feature scaling and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
